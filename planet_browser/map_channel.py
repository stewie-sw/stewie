"""map_channel.py -- the LAC section 10 map-channel reward, closed into the planning/autonomy loop.

The Lunar Autonomy Challenge objective rewards building an ACCURATE ELEVATION MAP of the worksite, not
just reaching waypoints. There are two perception tiers (docs/world_model.md, validation/map_channel/):

  * the DENSE reconstruction tier (Godot render -> onboard-stereo / ground COLMAP MVS) gives a real
    observed heightfield with a measurable RMSE vs the conserved truth. It is host / CUDA / container
    gated, so it is NOT in this in-loop path (see scripts/ros2_bridge + scripts/colmap).
  * the cheap ONBOARD-OBSERVABILITY tier, here: computed from the conserved truth, it scores what the
    PLANNED ROUTE actually SEES -- the worksite COVERAGE and the residual per-cell map uncertainty as the
    rover visits stations. This is a real, sub-millisecond, in-loop reward that gates dig commitment.

Honesty: this scores OBSERVABILITY (which worksite cells the route brings within sensor range), not a
reconstructed heightfield. Observed cells carry the published onboard-stereo height sigma [CALIB ~0.32 m,
validation/map_channel]; unobserved cells carry a high prior. No fabricated heights -- the dense RMSE is
the gated tier above. "Closing the reward into the loop" = the route's coverage/uncertainty is reported
AND a low-coverage dig site triggers observe-more before the rover commits to digging there.
