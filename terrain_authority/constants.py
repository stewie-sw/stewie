"""Physical constants and calibration parameters for the Tier-2 lunar regolith surrogate.

ALL VALUES ARE SI. The spec (§5) quotes densities in g/cm^3 and several moduli in
kN units; everything here is converted to base SI (kg/m^3, Pa, m, rad) so that the
on-disk contract (INTERFACE.md §4 "SI everywhere to kill unit ambiguity") holds with
zero conversion at the consumer.

Sources are cited inline by spec table (§5.1 fixed / §5.2 calibration) AND, where a
paper anchors the number, by papers/ filename + the specific claim. We deliberately do
NOT open the PDFs; citations name the claim a reviewer can check.

CALIBRATION STATUS legend (used in comments):
