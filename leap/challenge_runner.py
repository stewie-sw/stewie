"""Challenge runner (M1 / H3) — run an agent against a challenge, emit a scorecard.

`run(agent, challenge)` realizes the challenge into a `TerrainTargetEnv`, rolls the
agent (a callable obs -> action) to termination/truncation, and returns a deterministic
`Scorecard`: success + primary metric + constraint usage + a composite score. Because
the env's physics authority conserves mass and runs deterministically, the score is
reproducible and unhackable. The same scorecard doubles as the RL reward summary and the
LAC-style competition metric.
