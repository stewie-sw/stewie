"""Terrain-derived solar illumination — local-horizon ray-march + PSR cold-trap gate.

Wave-2 integration seam W2-ILLUM (docs/dem_terrain_contract.md §8; feeds the demo's
per-face shadow attribution, docs/demo_spiral_contract.md §4). The grazing polar sun
(0-7 deg, K.SUN_ELEVATION_DEG_POLAR) is "exactly IPEx's perception challenge" (spec §8):
at 7 deg a metre of relief throws an ~8 m shadow, so whether a rover-scale feature is lit
is a property of the TERRAIN around it, not of a flat plane.

WHAT THIS REPLACES.  The downstream face-illumination check (demo §4 "face_illum") and the
hillshade previews treat "lit" as a flat-plane fact: the sun is up iff its elevation > 0,
and matplotlib's LightSource shades by LOCAL NORMAL only (it has no cast-shadow / horizon
term). That flat-plane elev>0 stand-in marks a deep crater floor LIT whenever the sun is
above the mathematical horizon, even when the crater wall blocks the line of sight. This
module replaces that stand-in with a per-pixel LOCAL-HORIZON ray-march: a pixel is lit only
if NOTHING along the sun-ward ray rises above its line of sight at elevation sun_el_deg.

SELF-FLAG / HONESTY (binding portfolio discipline).  This is a TERRAIN-DERIVED local
horizon computed from the heightmap we already own. It is NOT a PGDA Product-69 (LOLA
"average / maximum / longest-night" illumination) ingest: there is no Product-69 reader and
no Product-69 raster on disk in this repo. Product-69 bakes in the true ephemeris (multi-
year sun track, libration, and the FAR horizon out to tens of km) that a single-tile
heightmap cannot see; this is the single-epoch, single-tile geometric horizon for ONE
(az, el) sun position. Treat it as a geometry-accurate shadow stand-in, not a validated
illumination/PSR product. See docs/dem_terrain_contract.md §8 (W2-ILLUM).

AZIMUTH CONVENTION (stated so it is auditable).  Grids here are row-major with origin at
the lower-left (rows index +Z "north", cols index +X "east"; the repo's hillshade/preview
convention, io_fields.write_hillshade_png / viz.variety_panel use origin="lower" with
xlabel "col (+X)", ylabel "row (+Z)"). ``sun_az_deg`` is the compass bearing the sunlight
comes FROM, measured CLOCKWISE FROM +Z(north): 0 deg = light from +Z (top of the array),
90 deg = light from +X (right), matching the cartographic azimuth used by the hillshade
preview's azdeg. We ray-march TOWARD the sun (up-sun) to find the first occluder.

    A pixel is ILLUMINATED iff, marching up-sun (toward the source) across the heightmap,
    no cell rises above the straight line of sight that leaves the pixel at elevation
    ``sun_el_deg``. Equivalently: the local horizon angle in the sun's azimuth is BELOW the
    sun's elevation. This is the cast-shadow term the flat-plane ``elev>0`` stand-in and the
    normal-only hillshade lack (see module docstring).

    Parameters
    ----------
    heightmap : (H, W) float array, surface height [m] (any datum; only differences matter).
    cell_m    : grid spacing [m] (square cells; the .rf32 contract is isotropic).
    sun_az_deg: bearing the light comes FROM, deg clockwise from +Z/north (see module
                docstring azimuth convention); the march steps TOWARD this bearing.
    sun_el_deg: sun elevation above the horizontal [deg]. ``<= 0`` -> sun at/below the
                mathematical horizon -> everything dark (returns all-False).

    Returns
    -------
    (H, W) bool array, True where the pixel sees the sun.

    Method: a single sweep of ``max_steps`` integer cell-steps along the up-sun unit vector
    (bilinear-free nearest-cell sampling, like the hillshade's nearest-neighbour shading).
    For step k at horizontal distance d_k = k*cell_m*|step|, a sun-ward cell of height h_s
    blocks a pixel of height h_p iff h_s - h_p > d_k * tan(el): the rising line of sight is
    overtopped. We accumulate the per-pixel maximum required clearance and shadow any pixel
    that is ever overtopped. O(H*W*max_steps); max_steps bounds the horizon search to the
    tile (a single heightmap cannot see a horizon beyond its own extent anyway, hence the
    Product-69 caveat in the module docstring).

    line, spec §5.1/§5.2; LCROSS-class cold trap). This call FINALLY CONSUMES that constant,

    HONESTY (terrain-derived gate, NOT a thermal model).  We do NOT model temperature: there
    is no thermal solver, no Product-69/Diviner ingest, and no insolation time-integral here.
    The gate is the geometric NECESSARY condition for a cold trap under this lane's single-
    epoch local-horizon shadow: a pixel can only be a candidate cold trap if it is shadowed
    NOW (``~illuminated``). ``t_psr_k`` is carried as the documented threshold the geometry
    is screening FOR, and is asserted to be a physical cryogenic value (0 K < t_psr_k <
    freezing); it does not enter a temperature computation because none exists. A real PSR
    determination needs the multi-year illumination integral (PGDA Product-69) plus a thermal
