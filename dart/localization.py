"""Map-relative localization — register an observed local elevation patch onto the PRIOR DEM (the SLAM
"overlay" / Gao Xiang *SLAM in Autonomous Driving* Ch10 fusion-positioning). docs/slam_pipeline_analysis.md.

dustgym already HAS the prior map (the LOLA DEM), so the rover localizes by matching what it senses to the
stored map -- not by building a map from scratch. This is the heightfield analog of ICP/NDT scan-to-map
registration: an integer-cell shift search that minimizes the MEAN-REMOVED SSD between the observed patch and
the DEM (mean-removed so an absolute datum/height offset doesn't bias it -- only terrain SHAPE matters).

Pure numpy; scored against the conserved-truth DEM (no gate). The corrected pose feeds the autonomy ESKF as
an independent map fix (P15 step 2). Sub-cell refinement + yaw recovery are the follow-on. The LIVE sensed
patch (Godot render -> stereo/COLMAP) is render/CUDA-gated; the registration math here is testable now by
sensing a patch from the truth and recovering a perturbed pose.
