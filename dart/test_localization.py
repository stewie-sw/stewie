"""Tests for map-relative localization (the scan-to-DEM 'overlay', P15 step 1).

Registers an observed elevation patch SENSED FROM THE CONSERVED-TRUTH DEM and recovers a perturbed pose --
no synthetic terrain (the real Haworth DEM is both the map and the truth the patch is sensed from). The flat
region uses a controlled zero patch to assert the ambiguity (low confidence) case.
