"""Tests for the in-loop map-channel reward (P6 / LAC section 10), the onboard-observability tier.

Real planner missions; the worksite + coverage are computed from the conserved order frame (no synthetic
data). The dense reconstruction RMSE is the separate, gated render/COLMAP tier (not exercised here).
