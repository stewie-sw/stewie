"""mission_planner.py — SimCity-Space lunar build planner + mission-control report.

Takes a MISSION (build orders on a map), CUT-FILL BALANCES it (route excavated material to fills,
minimizing haul), OPTIMIZES the execution sequence (TSP + battery-aware mid-task recharge), and outputs
a 2-3 page mission-control REPORT (PDF + markdown): coordinates, actions, speed, battery-draw over the
project, cumulative mass/energy, the material balance, and metrics.

Order kinds:
  cut    — excavate a footprint to a depth -> PRODUCES regolith (energy: 4151 J/kg dig).
  fill   — berm/pad/road raise -> CONSUMES regolith (supplied from the nearest cut; hauled in drum loads).
  sinter — fuse a surface into hard pad/road (the lunar concrete analog) IN PLACE -> energy 0.92 MJ/kg
           (~220x dig; the energy bottleneck), no material moved.

Grounded: per-body density/gravity from bodies.json (sysrev terrain_authority/bodies.py); IPEx +
sinter constants from terrain_authority (ipex_specs, constants). The recharge power and sinter-head
power are [CALIB] (no IPEx solar/sinter spec).
Run:  python3 mission_planner.py
