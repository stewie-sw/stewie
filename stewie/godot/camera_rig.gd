class_name CameraRig
# Declarative 8-camera rig for the SLAM/perception egress
# (docs/sensor_bridge_contract.md §2, §4). A small extrinsics TABLE + a builder that
# mounts Camera3Ds (each in its own shared-World3D SubViewport, mirroring
# sidecar.gd::_probe_multicam_capture) on the articulated rover root.
#
# FRAME: all offsets below are in the ROVER ROOT's LOCAL frame, which is the
# §3 Godot convention (right-handed, +Y up, camera looks -Z). The rover's FORWARD
# is local +X (sidecar.gd header: front wheels LF/RF sit at +X; the chase camera
# treats +X as forward). So:
#   * forward  = local +X   (front pair looks this way -> the lander/tag)
#   * back     = local -X   (rear pair looks this way -> second stereo baseline)
#   * up       = local +Y   (mast height is +Y)
#   * lateral  = local +Z / -Z  (the FRONT stereo baseline runs along Z;
#                                the side monos look along +Z / -Z)
#
# M1 was TWO cameras (front_left, front_right). This is the full M3 8-camera rig
# (contract §4 reserved identifiers): the front pair is UNCHANGED (so M1/M2 do not
# regress) and the six reserved cameras are ADDED to the same CAMERAS table, which
# sidecar.gd::_cameras_capture already iterates generically (each new entry is
# captured + emitted automatically, no sidecar.gd edit).
