"""Vehicle / power-source / tool registries (extensibility — PRD O4 + MV6).

Mirrors the Body/BODIES pattern in bodies.py: a frozen spec + a registry, so adding a vehicle, a power
source, or a tool is ONE entry rather than a global edit. Three design rules baked in here:

  * **Power is a separate entity.** A ``PowerSource`` is its own spec; a vehicle does NOT own its power.
    The assignment is an N:N ``PowerGrid`` over fleet-instance names (a source can serve many vehicles;
    a vehicle can draw from many sources).
  * **Tools are separate entities.** The sinter head is a ``Tool`` that GRANTS the ``sinter`` capability;
    it is NOT a capability of the IPEx drum excavator. A bare ``ipex`` cannot sinter; an ``ipex`` with
    the sinter tool mounted can.
  * **The ``.py`` is the single source of truth** ("everything stays .py"): every default is here with a
    provenance tag, like bodies.py. JSON is only ever a GENERATED export for the browser (gen_bodies_json),
    never the source.

Phase A is purely additive (nothing imports this yet but the tests). Threading ``vehicle=`` / the grid
through the drive/env/planner chain (like ``body=``) and capability-gating actions are the next phases.
