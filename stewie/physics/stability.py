"""Static tip-over stability — the "don't tip" criterion (RL trains against it; the planner avoids it).

A 4-wheel rover on a tilted surface tips when its centre-of-mass projection crosses the support-polygon
edge. The static stability angle (SSA) about each body axis is ``atan(half_support / cg_height)``: ROLL
about the track (half = gauge/2), PITCH about the wheelbase (half = base/2). The rover is stable while
``|roll| < SSA_roll`` and ``|pitch| < SSA_pitch``; the margin is how many degrees remain on the binding axis.

RASSOR (KSC-TOPS-7 / US 9,027,265) makes tipping TERRAIN-driven, not DIG-driven: the counter-rotating bucket
drums cancel the horizontal dig reaction, so excavation adds ~no tipping moment (unlike a terrestrial
excavator that levers against its own weight). RASSOR is also symmetric and "recovers from overturning", so
a tip is recoverable, not fatal — but planning and RL still avoid it (recovery costs time + risk).

Geometry: the modeled rover's gauge/wheelbase live in ``rover.WHEEL_GAUGE_M`` / ``WHEEL_BASE_M`` (0.57 /
0.40 m); ``cg_height`` is an [ASSUMPTION] (``constants.CG_HEIGHT_M``) — the exact RASSOR/IPEx centre of mass
is not in the public spec, so it is a documented, env-overridable assumption, not a fabricated datum. With
the modeled gauge>wheelbase the PITCH axis binds (the rover is wider than it is long), so driving straight
up/down a steep grade tips before cross-slope does.
