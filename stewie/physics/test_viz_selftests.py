"""Cover the tiles_mosaic / dem_overlay self-test harnesses by invoking them.

Each module ships its own acceptance harness — ``tiles_mosaic._selftest()`` (the Lane-C corridor-LOD
checks) and ``dem_overlay._self_test()`` (the conservation-critical procgen-overlay checks). They run
the REAL deterministic algorithms (coord-seeded fbm, coarsen/refine round-trips, crater carving) and
return 0 only when every internal invariant holds. Calling them here both exercises the harness code
and re-asserts those invariants (mass conservation to the float64 floor, byte-identical regeneration,
detail-actually-added). No synthetic measurement data — the harnesses generate their own
deterministic fixtures from the modules' own math.

Run from the repo root:
    PYTHONPATH=. <venv>/bin/python -m pytest the conserved authority/test_viz_selftests.py -q
