Companion overview [ICE-RASSOR]: NTRS 20210021455 (excavate / scoop / haul / dump / process actions).

The 2020/2021 RASSOR had NO load cell: drum regolith mass was INFERRED from existing motor telemetry
(arm/drum motor position, velocity, current, voltage, and robot pose) -- no added hardware, hence no new
failure modes. Three model STRUCTURES were developed; the Arm-Raise (AR) and Free-spinning Drum Current
(FDC) models were validated on hardware against a load-cell measurement hoist (Fig 3):

  * Arm-Raise (AR): drum mass is LINEAR in the integrated arm-motor power during an arm raise/lower --
    lifting the loaded drum is gravity work. Front R^2 = 0.996, rear R^2 = 0.974 (Fig 6).
  * Free-spinning Drum Current (FDC): at constant drum velocity, the steady (non-digging) average drum
    current rises with the carried mass; mass is LINEAR in that average current. Front R^2 = 0.989,
    rear R^2 = 0.985 (Fig 8). A neural-net augmentation maps (drum velocity, average current) -> mass to
    remove the velocity dependence (Fig 10) and was integrated in the flight-ready system. The LINEAR
    FDC model had the best hardware accuracy: mean percent error 7.40% over the mass range (11.84% with
    two outlier dig cycles), and 2.56% when the drum is more than half full (> ~20 kg).
  * Excavation Drum Current (EDC): mass excavated per dig cycle is linear in the aggregated drum current
    over the cycle; lower fidelity, R^2 = 0.76 (Fig 12).

WHAT WE TAKE, honestly: the model STRUCTURE (linear), the validated QUALITY (R^2, mean percent error),
and the realistic drum-fill KNOWLEDGE UNCERTAINTY a motor-current estimate carries -- so the autonomy
layer plans against imperfect drum-fill knowledge (e.g. "go offload at the processing plant when the
drums read full") instead of assuming exact mass. The exact fit COEFFICIENTS are NOT published (figures
only) and are RASSOR-hardware / 1-g-simulant specific -- the paper's own Future Work calls for lunar /
low-g recalibration -- so this module does NOT hard-code fabricated slopes/intercepts: LinearMassModel
must be calibrated from data (.fit) before it predicts. The arm-raise term is grounded from first
principles (gravity work, gravity-aware via bodies.py g), which is physically what the AR model's
R^2 = 0.996 linearity reflects.
