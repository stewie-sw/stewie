"""Sandpile cellular automaton — collapse / angle-of-repose relaxation (spec §7).

This is the showpiece mechanic: the grid-native answer to collapsing piles. Per spec §7:

    1. Dump adds mass to cells under the drum.
    2. A relaxation sweep checks each LOOSE cell's slope to its neighbors.
    3. Any cell exceeding the CRITICAL ANGLE topples EXCESS MASS downhill until all
       loose slopes are <= the angle of repose.

O(active cells) per tick, loose regions only. Produces avalanches, repose-angle slopes,
and slumping on overbuild/undercut (the cave-in time series in scenes.py).

CRITICAL DESIGN POINT (spec §7, §10): we topple **excess MASS, not height**. Mass is the
conserved invariant (INTERFACE.md §4); height is derived from mass/density. We compute the
height needed to bring a slope back to repose, convert that height delta to a MASS delta
at the donor cell's density, move that mass to the lower neighbor, and re-derive height.
The grid total mass is invariant by construction (mass only moves between cells).

Two knobs (spec §7): the repose angle theta_r (wide-envelope calibration unknown, see
constants.py / lyasko2010.pdf reduced-g granular flow is unsettled) and an optional
cohesion term that lets piles stand briefly steeper (metastability is itself a perception
hazard — a 'stable' berm that later slumps; spec §7).
