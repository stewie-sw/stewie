"""terrain_authority.world_model: the dustgym package's coherent world-model surface.

Ties the five world-model layers (see docs/world_model.md) to their package modules, so one import
gives you the whole model for terrain *transformation*. The physics-side layers (Geometry, Material,
Physics, Task) ship in this package; the perception-side layers (the map-channel scorer and the
per-cell Uncertainty field) live in the app layer (scripts/ros2_bridge, planet_browser) because they
need the Godot render and the planner, and are referenced here rather than imported.

The design call (docs/world_model.md): conserved physics for the DYNAMICS (exact, sub-ms, unhackable;
model-based search beats model-free RL) + a thin learned model only for PERCEPTION. So the package
exposes the conserved model directly; learning is reserved for the observation branch.
