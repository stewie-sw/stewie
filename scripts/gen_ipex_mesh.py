"""gen_ipex_mesh.py — author a self-made, CC0 parametric IPEx render body (no third-party mesh).

The Godot sidecar assembles the rover from separable part-glbs placed at joint origins
(rover_body + wheel + drum + drum_arm; see godot_sidecar/sidecar.gd). The default parts are
converted from the MIT EZ-RASSOR URDF (a RASSOR-class *demonstration* robot). Because no public /
CC0 mesh of the actual IPEx flight vehicle exists, this script BUILDS one from primitives
(box chassis + cylinder wheels + cylinder bucket drums + box arms), dimensioned from the
published IPEx numbers. We author every vertex, so the output is CC0 (it removes the rover's one
third-party dependency) and stays in sync with the physics constants by construction.

Honest fidelity: this is a DIMENSIONALLY-FAITHFUL PRIMITIVE model, not the IPEx flight CAD. The
wheel (30.5 cm dia) and bucket drum (IPEx medium, 295x246 mm) are sourced; the chassis box,
wheelbase, wheel width and arm length carry NO published IPEx number and are tagged [CALIB] below
(plausible 30 kg-class values, refined when IPEx CAD becomes available). Nothing here is passed off
as flight geometry.

  Sourced: terrain_authority.ipex_specs (Schuler ASCEND 2024 / Zhang wheel testing / Schuler BD scaling).
  Run: python -m scripts.gen_ipex_mesh   ->  writes godot_sidecar/assets/ipex/*.glb
