"""Spiral-departure trajectory generator (pure stdlib + math, host-runnable).

    python scripts/demo/spiral_path.py        # runs the self-test + prints the spiral

Lane DEMO-TRAJ (docs/demo_spiral_contract.md §1). Authors the per-frame
``rover_rc`` waypoints + heading for the "larger, longer" departure demo: an
AprilTag lander is FIXED at the scene CENTER (§0 binding decision) and the rover
drives an Archimedean spiral *outward* from it. The monotonically increasing range
is the mechanism that drives the wanted ``out_of_range`` failure mode (§0, §4) --
the tag eventually becomes too far to resolve.

Two outputs, both pure functions of their args (deterministic; no engine, no
numpy -- stdlib ``math`` only so this is trivially host-testable and matches the
"pure python (host)" line of the contract):

  * ``spiral_rc``     -- the [row,col] waypoint list (the repo's rover_rc channel,
                         [row,col]; see scenes.py:109/503/799).
  * ``look_at_yaw``   -- the per-frame heading that keeps the rover's +forward
                         (front stereo) pointed at the lander, in the SAME yaw
                         convention as the Godot rig so the tag stays in frustum.

YAW CONVENTION (load-bearing -- READ from source, not invented):
  godot_sidecar/sidecar.gd:357-378  ``_heading_yaw``:
      dx := b.y - a.y   # col delta -> +X
      dz := b.x - a.x   # row delta -> +Z
      return atan2(-dz, dx)   # point rover forward (+X) along travel
  godot_sidecar/capture_seq.gd:83-94 uses the identical (dx=col, dz=row,
      yaw=atan2(-dz, dx)) form, citing sidecar._heading_yaw as the convention.
  the conserved authority/scenes.py:473-480 ``_heading_from_segment`` is a DIFFERENT
      convention -- atan2(drow, dcol), the INTERFACE.md §5.2 travel-heading used
      to orient wheel cleats, NOT the Godot rover yaw. The contract §1 names
      ``atan2(-dz, dx)`` (the Godot rover yaw), so ``look_at_yaw`` matches the
      sidecar/capture_seq form, NOT _heading_from_segment. (The function the
      contract calls ``scenes._heading_yaw`` does not exist by that name; the
      live yaw convention lives in the .gd rig, which is what renders the demo.)

  To "look at" the center, the heading is computed on the vector FROM the rover
  TO the center (the direction +forward must point), i.e. the same atan2(-dz, dx)
  with (dx, dz) = (center_col - rover_col, center_row - rover_row).

    r(θ) = r0_cells + r_growth_cells * θ/2π,  θ in [0, 2π*turns]   (cells)

    Sampled at ``n_frames`` evenly spaced θ. Because r(θ) is affine and strictly
    increasing in θ (for r_growth_cells > 0), the range to center is monotonically
    increasing along the path -- the rover progressively departs, which drives the
    ``out_of_range`` failure (docs/demo_spiral_contract.md §0, §4).

    Args:
        center_rc:        (row, col) lander cell, the spiral center.
        n_frames:         number of waypoints to emit (>= 1).
        turns:            number of full revolutions (θ spans [0, 2π*turns]).
        r0_cells:         starting radius at θ=0, in cells.
        r_growth_cells:   radius gained per full turn, in cells (the Archimedean
                          pitch: r grows r_growth_cells over each 2π of θ).
        cell_m:           cell size [m]; accepted for unit completeness so callers
                          carry one source of truth (scenes.CELL_M). The returned
                          rc are in CELL units (the rover_rc channel is cells), so
                          cell_m does not scale the output -- it is validated only.

    Returns:
        list[(row, col)] of length n_frames, floats (sub-cell; the demo authors a
